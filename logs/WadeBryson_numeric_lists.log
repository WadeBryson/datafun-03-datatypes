2023-05-26 10:14:45,014 Your list of point differentials = [4, 8, -12, 20, 12, 3, -5, -7, 21, -5, -23, 32, 27, 10, 5, 4, 7, 8, -10, 17]
2023-05-26 10:14:45,014 Below is your data about your 10 Day Free Throw Challenge.
2023-05-26 10:14:45,014 Days:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
2023-05-26 10:14:45,014 Total Free Throws Made:[100, 200, 295, 405, 500, 620, 680, 800, 910, 1050]
2023-05-26 10:14:45,034 Let's look at some basic statistics regarding your point differentials list!
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 mean   = 5.80
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 median = 6.00
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 mode   = 4.00
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 var    = 187.85
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 stdev  = 13.71
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 Let's explore the relationship created from your 10 Day Free Throw Challenge
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 The correlation between your Days and Total Free Throws Made = 1.00
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 The slope for your line of best fit = 102.97
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 The y-intercept for your line of best fit = -10.33
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 The equation for your line of best fit is y = 102.97x +-10.33
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 If you keep up the Free Throw Challenge for 5 more days I predict you will have made a total of 1534.00 free throws!
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 Your worst point differential was -23.
2023-05-26 10:14:45,038 Your best point differential was 32.
